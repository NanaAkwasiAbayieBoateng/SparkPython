    "#### A Tutorial on Spark in Python \n",
    "You might already know Apache Spark as a fast and general engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing. It’s well-known for its speed, ease of use, generality and the ability to run virtually everywhere. And even though Spark is one of the most asked tools for data engineers, also data scientists can benefit from Spark when doing exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, supervised learning and model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Welcome to Apache Spark with Python\n",
    "Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.\n",

    "#### Intro\n",
    "Pipeline concept is definitely not new for software world, Unix pipe operator (|) links two tasks putting the output of one as the input of the other. In machine learning solutions it is pretty much usual to apply several transformation and manipulation to datasets, or to different portions or sample of the same dataset (from classic test/train slices to samples taken for cross-validation procedure). In these cases, pipelines are definitely useful to define a sequence of tasks chained together to define a complete process, which in turn simplifies the operation of the ml solution. In addition, in BigData environment, it is possible to apply the “laziness” of execution to the entire process in order to make it more scalable and robust, therefore no surprise to see pipeline implemented in Spark machine learning library and R API available, by SparklyR package, to leverage the construct. Pipeline component in Spark are basically of two types :\n",
    "\n",
    "**transformer:** since dataframe usually need to undergo several kinds of changes column-wide, row-wide or even single value-wide, transformers are the component meant to deliver these transformations. Typically a transformer has a table or dataframe as input and delivers a table/dataframe as output. Sparks, through MLlib, provide a set of feature’s transformers meant to address most common transformations needed;\n",
    "estimator: estimator is the component which delivers a model, fitting an algorithm to train data. Indeed fit() is the key method for an estimator and produces, as said a model which is a transformer. Leveraging the parallel processing which is provided by Spark, it is possible to run several estimators in parallel on different training dataset in order to find the best solution (or even to avoid overfitting issue). ML algorithms are basically a set of **Estimators**, they build a rich set of machine learning (ML) common algorithms, available from MLlib. This is a library of algorithms meant to be scalable and run in a parallel environment. Starting from the 2.0 release of Spark, the RDD-based library is in maintenance mode (the RDD-based APIs are expected to be removed in 3.0 release) whereas the mainstream development is focused on supporting dataframes. In MLlib features are to be expressed with labeledpoints, which means numeric vectors for features and predictors.Pipelines of transformers are, even for this reason, extremely useful to operationalize an ML solutions Spark-based. For additional details on MLlib refer to Apache Spark documentation\n",
    "In this post we’ll see a simple example of pipeline usage and we’ll see two version of the same example: the first one using Scala (which is a kind of “native” language for Spark environment), afterward we’ll see how to implement the same example in R, leveraging SaprklyR package in order to show how powerful and complete it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The dataset\n",
    "For this example, the dataset comes from UCI – Machine Learning Repository Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science. “Adults Income” dataset reports individual’s annual income results from various factors. The annual income will be our label (it is divided into two classes: <=50K and >50K) and there are 14 features, for each individual, we can leverage to explore the possibility in predicting income level. For additional detail on “adults dataset” refer to the UCI machine learning repository http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/adult/desc.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scala code\n",
    "As said, we’ll show how we can use scala API to access pipeline in MLlib, therefore we need to include references to classes we’re planning to use in our example and to start a spark session :"

To recode “working class” and “marital” columns we’ll use UDF functions which in turn are wrappers of the actual recoding functions.

    "In our example, we’re going to use 12 features, 7 are categorical variables and 5 are numeric variables. The feature’s array we’ll use to fit the model will be the results of merging two arrays, one for categorical variables and the second one for numeric variables. Before building the categorical variables array, we need to transform categories to indexes using transformers provided by spark.ml, even the label must be transformed to an index. Our pipeline then will include 7 pipeline stages to transform categorical variables, 1 stage to transform the label, 2 stages to build categorical and numeric arrays, and the final stage to fit the logistic model. Finally, we’ll build an 11-stages pipeline.\n",
    "To transform categorical variables into index we’ll use “Stringindexer” Transformer. StringIndexer encodes a vector of string to a column of non-negative indices, ranging from 0 to the number of values. The indices ordered by label frequencies, so the most frequent value gets index 0. For each variable, we need to define the input column and the output column which we’ll use as input for other transformer or evaluators. Finally it is possible to define the strategy to handle unseen labels (possible when you use the Stringindexer to fit a model and run the fitted model against a test dataframe) through setHandleInvalid method , in our case we simply put “skip” to tell Stringindexer we want to skip unseen labels (additional details are available in MLlib documentation).\n",
